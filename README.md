# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
